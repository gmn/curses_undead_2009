
/* 2 kinds of dialog: (like Fallout 2),

1 - word ballons, or just square areas filled with characters appear above
the NPCs head.  They could be daydreaming, talking aloud, talking right to
you, whistling a tune, having a conversation with a second NPC, .. anything 
that can be overheard.

Scene / World movement & interaction are not halted, everything continues on
as normal

You can also have a character say go away in word balloon form, and never
even allow to be entered into focused dialog mode

2 - focused dialog.  This is the kind that takes place when you are engaged
in a face-to-face conversation with an NPC.  The screen changes.  You see a
picture of their face, and a large dialog box in the bottom half.  You are
able to choose responses from lists.  You can ask questions to ellicit 
responses.  The world stops moving outside.  You do not even see the world.
You must exit the conversation for world movement to resume.

Focused dialog shouldn't be restricted to just people.  It could be a pop
machine, a computer monitor, where you are given choices, perhaps the ability
to type in a code.  the pop machine could debit your account $0.65..

There can also be an element of abruptnes to this dialog mode.  You should
have the default dialog be "Go Away", with about a 5 second pause, before the
screen automatically switches back to the gameplay screen.

you could also do cell-phones, web-browsers and other interfaces, apt. intercom,
through this screen.  Just make it smart enough so that you can do complex
input, like type a string, or press numbers.  picture of a cell phone with
exagerated keypad, highlight the number on the keypad as you press it, and
have the number accumulate in the text box as you press digits.
