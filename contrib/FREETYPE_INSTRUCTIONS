
* unzip ft236.zip

* cd freetype-2.3.6/builds/win32/visualc/

* open freetype.sln with VS.2005

* 4 choices to compile: single-threaded/multi-threaded, Debug/Release

* copy everything from freetype-2.3.6/include to your system include directory.
	( mine is  C:\include )  The new dir should be called:  C:\include\freetype

* similarly, copy the *.lib file from freetype-2.3.6/objs into your system
	lib directory.  ((( mine's C:\lib )))

* Make sure those paths are setup in your project

* make sure you include ft2build.h and the *.lib in your project preferences
